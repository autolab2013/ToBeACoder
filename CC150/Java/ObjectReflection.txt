14.5 Explain what object reflection is in Java ad why it is useful.

Object reflection:
learn on [Oracle Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/class/classNew.html)

provide a way to get reflective info about classes and objects, and perform actions such as:
- to get info about the method/fields inside class at runtime
- to create a new instance of a class
- to get/set object fields directly by getting field reference, regardless of what the access modifier is.

it is useful for:
- obeserving/manipulating runtime behavior of application
- debugging/testing, can access to methods, constructors and fields
- call methods we dont't know by name: given a lass name, paramsfor constructor and a method name, we can 
use this info to create an object and call a method.
