In term of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

Suppose class A has a private constructor.
To access the constructor only A can, or if A is an inner class of Q then other inner class in Q also can.
A can only be inherited by its own or its parent's inner classes.
(Singleton used private constructor)
