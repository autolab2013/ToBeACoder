/** User inputs a series of numbers and terminates the series by a zero. 
 *  Your program should find the first three maximum values in the series and 
 *  exclude them from the series and compute the average of the remaining numbers. (excluding zero as well)
 *  Ex - 3, 7, 12, 2, 25, 8, 9, 13, 10, 0
 *  First three maximum numbers = 25, 13, 12
 *  Average of the rest = (3 + 7 + 2 + 8 + 9 + 10) / 6 = 6.5
