- What the interviewer is looking for:
	- Big picture understanding: 
		- e.g. prioritize test case
	
	- Knowing how the pieces fit together: 
		- how software fits into a bigger system
		
	- Organization:
		- in a structured approach, break into pieces
		
- testing a real world object:
	- Question: How would you test a paperclip?
