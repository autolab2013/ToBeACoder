Chap 7
===

- Prime Nubers
	
	- Divisibility
		gcd(), lcm()
	- Checking for primality
		loop terminated after the sqrt of the number
	- Generating a list of primes:
		The Sieve of Eratosthenes, build a boolean array with index indicating the number and true for primal
		set the index which is divisible by current prime index to false
		
- Probability
	- Independence and mutual exclusivity
		for non-zero probability P(A) and P(B), A and B cannot be independent and mutual exclusive at the same time
